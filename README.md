ðŸ”’ Security: Oauth login for your organisation's users, just setup a google oauth app for internal access and pass the client id.


## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To getting started in local development environment, just fork the project git repository and follow the below steps:

Execute the shell script `setup.sh` to automatically setup the Frontend and the Backend codes.(Make sure your terminal has appropriate permissions to execute a shellscript)

The shellscript will install appropriate dependencies both for frontend and backend codes, and also create `.env` files populated with sample values.

Follow the below steps to populate real `.env` values for specific variables:

To get the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` follow below steps:
1. Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Create a project
3. Setup Oauth Consent screen
4. Under Credentials tab create a credential, Chose `Oauth Client Id` from the dropdown
5. Give application type as `Web Application`
6. Give a name to the credential of your choice
7. For `Authorized JavaScript origins` add 2 values: `http://localhost:3000` & `http://localhost`
8. For `Authorized redirect URIs` add 2 values: `http://localhost:3001/login` and `http://localhost` and press `Create`
9. This would create a google Oauth credential for you and a modal would open copy the `Client ID` and paste in 2 places

Replace value: [`REACT_APP_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`](/.env) <-- click
Replace value: [`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`](/Server/.env) <-- click

Now your setup should be completed ðŸ¤ž

Now to run the app locally:  
1. Make sure your mongoDb is running locally, and you have opened your mongoDB compass
2. In the root directory run `npm start`
3. Open a new Terminal tab, go inside the `Server folder` and run `npm start`
4. That should start your Frontend app in port: `3000` and backend in port: `3001`. Make sure the ports are exact as the Google Oauth client id is configured in that way above.
